# NIXIE_TUBE_for_Unity

This is a nixie tube that can be used in Unity.
This is the default rendering pipeline, so you will need to do a material conversion if you want to use it in URP or other applications.

A sample scene is included, so please use it as a reference.

## How to use

1,Place "NIXIETUBE" in the scene from /prefab.

2,Create an empty object and attach "improvement_NIXIEManager" from /Script.

3, Register an arbitrary "NIXIETUBE" and a numerical value to "improvement_NIXIEManager".

4,Ready to run
